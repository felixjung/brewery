# Brewery üçª

A very tiny node wrapper for [homebrew](http://brew.sh). I wrote this to use it
for installing things with my dotfiles manager.

At this point this only supports installing formulas and tapping new taps as
these are the things you might want to do when setting up your dotfiles.

## Installation
``` bash
npm install brewery
```
