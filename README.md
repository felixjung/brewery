# 🍻 Brewmaster 🍻
A very tiny node wrapper for [homebrew](http://brew.sh). I wrote this to use it for installing things with my dotfiles manager.

At this point this only supports installing formulas and tapping new taps as these are the things you might want to do when setting up your dotfiles.

## Requirements
Brewmaster is written in ES2015 and requires node v5.3.0.

## Installation

```bash
npm install brewmaster
```
